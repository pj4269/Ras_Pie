Feb 03, 23: To control Arduino from Python file: Use user-input from Python  
              1) Verify the ".uno" file
              2) Upload the ".uno" file
              3) Run the python code

Jan 25, 23: sudo apt install arduino  => installed version 2.1


Jan 20, 23: Goal:  TB6612FNG didn't work.  L298 code should work pin-for-pin! Make it work. 
        
        a) L298: 1 line splitting problem:  1] L298-V1 used 2 GND pins                      -> worked
                                            2] L298-V2 used board as a connector for 2 pins -> worked.

        b) TB6612FNG   : Very complicated hookup!                      : 4.5$  for dual motor     - I have it   
                       : another ref: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tb6612fng-hookup-guide/all                  
                                      
        c) DRV8871     : Seems very simple + stronger voltage          : 9.99$ for a single motor -> worked 
        
        d) MX1508      :  Simple hookup                                : 1.5$  for a dual motor                      
  
        Large motor: 
        
        a) BTS7960     : Seems simple                                 : 5$                       - Here
                       : Someone on amazon review controlled it a ras. pie: but seems very complicated. 
                       
        b) Cytron  MD25HV: Very expensive! 59$                                
         Lesson learned: Prefer simple drivers + Screws rather than plug-ins -> saves so much time. 
         
Jan 12, 23: L298 worked. => I understand how it works!
                        
          : Once you upload your code into Arduino, you can unplug it from your computer. 
          : Makes unpleasent noise!
